This is a program where you input a text file consisting of lines of characters.
. -> this character means the starting points(default).
x -> this character means targets(default).
[:space:] -> whitespace means empty cells we can travel to
Any other character means obstacle.
The program will read in such file and draw the shortest paths from starting
points to targets. The shortest paths will be drawn with @ character(default).
