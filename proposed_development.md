- Paths are highlighted in some way, for example by some color.
- Instead of a path character, the user can specify a string, where the path will be composed of that string's content.
- Provide the possibility to merge several files into one, so that the path search can be performed on such merged file.
- Provide the animation feature where the paths are drawn in animated way.
- The paths are drawn according to some schema provided by the user, where we will provide a simple domain language for defining path behavior.
- Add some minimization features, for example a feature where paffi returns the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted from the original file so that the resulting path is shortest possible.
- Add a shifter feature: for some path present for some file paffi can shift the whole file in such a way that the path is straightened.
